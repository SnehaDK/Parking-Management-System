## Parking-Management-System
In this project I used IOT and ML combinedly. Here I am using Vs Code for the code and for IOT code I used pyfirmata from Arduino IDE and the whole project was done using Python programming language. I used  the laptop camera and OpenCV library of Python and also used an IR(infrared sensor) Proximity Sensor for detecting the object.
Further features will be add on.
